- Replace "F" with "Female" and "M" with "Male" in the Gender column.
 
- Change currency format to the local format with no decimal places and comma separation.
 
- Create a new column for Age Brackets by defining different age ranges using nested IF conditions, which will facilitate dashboard creation.
